					<h1>Who are we</h1>
					<p>
						<img src="./assets/meeting-room.jpeg" alt="about us" />
						Founded in 2010, BlueFlame Engineering Ltd is registered
						in Nigeria as an ICT, Telecoms and Project Management
						solutions firm. Our primary focus is developing business
						solutions using ICT software, providing project
						management solutions and general services to companies
						that cut across all industries.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p class="whoWe">
						Our main objective is to use ICT as a tool for
						developing different types of business solutions that
						meets different organizational needs. <br />Our clients
						cut across Foreign missions to Pharmaceutical
						industries, from Shipping companies to Insurance firms,
						Banks, Govt Institutions etc and also cuts across
						various geographical regions in the country.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						BlueFlame is being managed by professionals with diverse
						backgrounds and expertise.
					</p>
					<h1 class="vision">Our Vision</h1>
					<p>
						To become a Leader (i.e. been the most preferred and
						trusted source) in providing ICT and Project Management
						services whereby we partner with our clients to achieve
						their goals and as they achieve theirs we achieve ours.
					</p>
					<h1 class="mission">Our Mission</h1>
					<p>
						To make ICT and Project Management services readily
						available to small, medium and Large scale enterprises
						which in turn provides a support system that is
						economical, efficient, durable and flexible for them as
						they strive to create wealth for the immediate community
						and the world at large.
					</p>
					<h1 class="target-market">Target Market</h1>
					<p class="paraMarket">
						Our customers are small and big businesses (Including
						Telecoms, Oil & Gas companies, FMCG, Banks but not
						limited to the above) that would need to enhance their
						IT and Telecoms solutions structure and would also need
						Project Managers to manage new and ongoing projects with
						the best cost saving techniques while delivering quality
						customer expectations. Such services would range from
						the supply and installation of IT equipments (Computers,
						Servers, Routers, cables etc), IT Asset management
						services to providing Telecoms services such as Fuelling
						of Sites, RF Drive testing for 2G and 3G networks,
						MSC/MSS (Mobile Soft switch) installation and
						maintenance, 2G and 3G radio upgrades and downgrades,
						Power installation, operation and maintenance and
						Project management services. We would also provide
						customers with 24hrs customer service support in the
						event of emergencies and enquiries. The market for our
						services is growing at an unprecedented rate. In 2010
						alone telecom services supplied to telecom firms have
						increased by 50% as compared to the years before also
						different companies in different industries have bought
						into the use of Project management processes and
						procedures to achieve set out goals and targets at cost
						effective rates while ensuring that quality standards
						are maintained as agreed with the client.
					</p>
					<h1 class="businessGW">Growth In Business</h1>
					<p>
						Due to the economic downslide being witnessed around the
						country and with most companies opting to contract such
						services such as ICT (IT and Telecoms) and Project mgmt
						services, while buying into the idea of project managing
						most new contracts being implemented. Also with the
						coming of the Power reforms, it is believed that apart
						from providing power support services be it
						installations, supply of technical equipments and
						maintenance when due, project management services would
						still be needed to make sure that all new contracts are
						implemented accordingly to meet customers’ requirements
						within agreed cost, while focusing on quality
						deliverables. With all these happening, there is a real
						potential for growth in our business which should
						definitely not be overlooked but be tapped into and
						developed.
